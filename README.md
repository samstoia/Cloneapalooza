# LollaClone

This is my attempt at recreating Lollapalooza's home page ahead of its 2019 festival.  

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.6.5.

## Features Available Right Now:

The site is a series of components made with Angular.  Right now, the page utilizes seven components which make up the structure of the home page.

## Features To Be Added:

In the coming weeks, this site will be deployed to firebase, and users will be able to join a mailing list which will utilize a firebase database.  New components will also be added that will build out some of the parts of the website.

## Setup and Installation:

1. Clone github repo: https://github.com/samstoia/Cloneapalooza
2. Navigate to cloned folder in the command line ($cd Cloneapalooza)
3. Once there, type "npm install" to install necessary packages and dependencies.  You should now be able to edit the code, and see the website by launching a development server.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
